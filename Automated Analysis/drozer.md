# Drozer

### How to use with AndroidTamer

Drozer is already pre configured within AndroidTamer. However there are some steps required before starting drozer.

1. We need to start device / emulator and connect that to the AndroidTamer Machine.
2. Once device connected we need to install a drozer_client APK.
3. Client apk is available via ```drozer_client_install``` command
as shown below
```android@tamer$ drozer_client_install <devicename>```
4. Once device shows that the apk is installed then we are ready to use drozer
5. To start using drozer type following
```android@tamer$ drozer_connect <device_name>```


### Dynamic Assessment via Drozer

Drozer at this point doesn't provide html/xml style reporting the report output is directly provided to the console.

AndroidTamer has a build in script which will automatically run all the modules that are available in drozer and will give you a textual output on screen. Its advised to save the output in a text file for further / delayed analysis.

```android@tamer$ drozer_check <package name> <device_name>```
