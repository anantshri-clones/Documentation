# Managing multiple devices

Due to massive fragmentation and the will of vendors to keep selling devices with old versions. Android Professionals are forced to work with multiple devices / emulator's with various versions of android loaded on them.

With this problem in mind we went ahead and [wrote a shim](https://github.com/AndroidTamer/adb_wrapper/) which should help us with this problem. To manage multiple devices in AndroidTamer you need to follow these steps

1. Create a file in your home folder called as ```.adb_list```

![adb list cat](/images/adb_list_cat.jpg)

2. Once the list is configured then you can go ahead and check the status of each device.

![adb list](/images/adb_list.jpg)

Here any device line marked as GREEN means its connected and RED means its not connected.

3. Now to connect to this device follow this command

```
android@tamer $ adb geny shell
```

Here you can see instead of remembering the complex ip address or serial number we can simply use the new name provided for this functionality.
